Run an eCommerce store in your cloud!

##Why EStoreJS?

EStoreJS started off as part of a bigger project to provide eCommerce related services
to businesses in Trinidad and Tobago. It's designed to be flexible and play nice with
third party applications and services.

##Current Status

EStoreJS is just about ready to run small, low traffic sites. It ships with a
default template to get you started.

##Features

* [KeystoneJS](http://keystonejs.com) as an admin interface.
* Nunjucks for templating.
* Product and Category management.
* Invoice generation.
* Shopping Cart
* A MongoDB backend.

##Requirements

To run EStoreJS you will need to have [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org) installed and access to a [MongoDB](http://mongodb.org) server.
The deploy to Heroku button takes care of this for you though.

You should also have [git](http://gitscm.org) installed.

##Setup

If you do not want to deploy to Heroku, clone the master branch.
Be sure to either create a .env file or set the environment with the following:

* MONGO_URI - Include the database name at the end of the uri.
* COOKIE_SECRET - If not supplied will be generated internally each time app starts.

Once that is take care of run `npm install` then `npm start` to get your app going.
